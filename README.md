We out here learning how to use github


Hey guys how's it going? My name is Mark and I am on here trying to learn how to use GitHub and see if it is something that could help me.
I am a third year student at UW-Madison, pursuing a degree in electrical engineering. I currently work at XES as an associate embedded engineer on the component
qualification team.
